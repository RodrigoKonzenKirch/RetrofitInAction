Retrofit in Action (Kotlin/Android)

A demonstration project showcasing best practices for networking in a modern Kotlin application, focusing on a layered architecture and robust data handling. 

This project implements the Repository Pattern to abstract data sources and uses Retrofit with Kotlin Coroutines for asynchronous API calls. 

A custom MockInterceptor is included to simulate all API traffic, allowing for complete offline development and unit testing without needing a live backend. 

This setup ensures a highly maintainable, testable, and robust data layer.
